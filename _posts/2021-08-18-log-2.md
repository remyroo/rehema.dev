**Today's Progress**
1. Created a Github repo for personal website and posted first logs.
2. Start on "EventManager" project.


**Thoughts**
I've selected one of the 4 "Checkpoint 1" projects - "Hangman" - but it requires that I complete another guided project called [EventManager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html) first to get familiar with reading to and from files.
