**Today's Progress**
1. Started Udemy's Advanced CSS and Sass course.


**Thoughts**
I want to get some practice with HTML and to update my CSS knowledge. Today I worked on initial project set up for "Natours" - the first website project in the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/).

I learned that it's possible to layer background images like a gradient over a jpeg to achieve that common look on landing pages e.g: `background_image: linear-gradient(to right, orange, red)`.

Also used the `clip-path` tool's `polygon` feature to form interesting shapes.
