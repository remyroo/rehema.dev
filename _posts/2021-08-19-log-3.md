**Today's Progress**
1. Continued on "EventManager" project.


**Thoughts**
The guided bits of the [EventManager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html) tutorial were straightforward, but the "Iteration" sections - specifically the one on Time Targeting, has provided an interesting challenge. Overall, I've brushed up on file I/O, DateTime and general problem breakdown.
I'll finish it up tomorrow.

I've also installed [toggle](https://toggl.com/track/) to show me how much time I actually spend working. Today has felt like ages but turns out it's just a little over 2 hours. I'm so out of practice it really tires me out haha!
The pomodoro functinoality reminds me to take breaks every 25mins which is crucial. I do have to remind myself that it's not a timer for speed but rather a helpful lreminder for a break - otherwise I start to feel anxious and like I should be working through the sections faster. But the whole point of this excercise for me is to feel ok going at my own pace. The speed will return eventually.
