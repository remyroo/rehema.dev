**Today's Progress**
1. Finished "EventManager" project.


**Thoughts**
`DateTime.parse` assumes the string you give it is in `d/m/y` format so it throws an ArgumentError when you pass in a US-style date like `11/25/2020`.

To get around this, you can use `DateTime.strptime` (string parse time) to clarify what you want parsed e.g. `DateTime.strptime('11/25/2020 10:30, %m/%d/%y %H:%Y')`. `DateTime.strftime` is responsible for formatting.

If you need to find the frequency that elements appear in an array, you can use the `#group_by`, [`#inject`](https://medium.com/@terrancekoar/inject-method-explained-ed531eff9af8) or `#tally` (in Ruby 2.7) methods.
